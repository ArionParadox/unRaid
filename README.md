# unRaid

This was created to control the fans in my Dell Poweredge. I am lucky enough to be on the right iDrac version to use this method. \n
I didn't want to get my temperatures from iDrac as currently some of my drives are outside the cooling shroud; hence needing to grab the data from smartctl.
